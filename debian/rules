# The following meta-package consolidates all the kernel packages required
# by the Delphix Appliance for a given platform. Note that delphix-kernel
# only has dependencies on kernel modules and tools that are built for a
# specific version of the kernel. Any additional tools that are not specific
# to a particular kernel version should be included in the "tools.list.chroot"
# file.

#
# The following packages are required in order to generate VM artifacts
# that are leveraging ZFS as their root filesystem.
#
DEPENDS += grub-pc, \

#
# The following packages provide the minimal set of packages that are
# necessary to create a working system (e.g. networking, users, etc).

# The following package contains the GPG keys which allow us to download
# from the repositories which contain packages containing debug symbols.

#
# This package contains a consolidation for third-party packages built
# by delphix as well as build info for all packages built by the linux-pkg
# framework.
#

#
# These packages are tools that are intended for human convenience. The
# product should not rely on them programmatically. They may be updated
# or replaced without regard for backward compatibility.
